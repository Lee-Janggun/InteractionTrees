(** ** Parametric functions *)

(** A notation for a certain class of parametric functions.
    Some common names of things that can be represented by such a type:

    - Natural transformations (functor morphisms)
    - Monad morphisms
    - Event morphisms (if [E] and [F] are simply
      indexed types with no particular structure)
    - Event handlers (if [F] is a monad)
 *)
Notation "E ~> F" := (forall T, E T -> F T)
  (at level 99, right associativity, only parsing) : type_scope.
(* The same level as [->]. *)
(* This might actually not be such a good idea. *)

(** Identity morphism. *)
Definition idM {E : Type -> Type} : E ~> E := fun _ e => e.

(** [void] is a shorthand for [Empty_set]. *)
Notation void := Empty_set.
